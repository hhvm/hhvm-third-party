winpthreads
================

Pthreads library from mingw-w64 - an MIT licensed pthreads implementation

This is a forked version of the code with cmake files and fixes for compiling/running
with MSVC (primarily the 14 (CTP) version)

This is needed only for MSVC builds - cygwin has it's own pthreads implementation and mingw-w64 ships with winpthreads
